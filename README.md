# 🎬 Turtle App - AI-Powered Home Theater Assistant

Every movie night starts the same, you spend hours searching for the perfect film, only to end up watching the same old favorites. **Turtle App is here to change that!**

This is a management system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and multi-agent orchestration to provide a unified interface for managing your personal movie collection, discovering new content, and controlling media downloads.

## 🎯 What Does This Do?

The Turtle App is your personal AI assistant for home theater management. It can:

- **🔍 Answer questions about movies** using a comprehensive database of movie summaries and metadata
- **💾 Manage your local movie library** by scanning and indexing your collection
- **⬬ Handle torrent downloads** through integration with qBittorrent
- **🤖 Maintain conversation context** across multiple interactions
- **🌐 Deploy as a web service** with both local and cloud deployment options

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system uses a **multi-agent supervisor architecture** built on LangGraph, where specialized agents handle different aspects of home theater management under the coordination of a supervisor agent.

- **Capabilities**:
  - Movie plot summaries and analysis
  - Movie recommendations based on genre, cast, or plot similarity
  - Metadata retrieval (cast, director, year, genre)
  - Semantic search across movie descriptions
- **Implementation**: `turtleapp/src/core/tools/movie_summaries_retriever.py`
- **Testing**: `turtleapp/tests/test_retriever.py`
