# üé¨ Turtle App - AI-Powered Home Theater Assistant

Every movie night starts the same, you spend hours searching for the perfect film, only to end up watching the same old favorites. **Turtle App is here to change that!**

This is a management system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and multi-agent orchestration to provide a unified interface for managing your personal movie collection, discovering new content, and controlling media downloads.

## üéØ What Does This Do?

The Turtle App is your personal AI assistant for home theater management. It can:

- **üîç Answer questions about movies** using a comprehensive database of movie summaries and metadata
- **üíæ Manage your local movie library** by scanning and indexing your collection
- **‚¨¨ Handle torrent downloads** through integration with qBittorrent
- **ü§ñ Maintain conversation context** across multiple interactions
- **üåê Deploy as a web service** with RESTful API endpoints

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system uses a **multi-agent supervisor architecture** built on LangGraph, where specialized agents handle different aspects of home theater management under the coordination of a supervisor agent.

## üß† Design Assumptions & Model Selection

### Why Different Models for Different Roles?

**Supervisor Agent: Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
- Handles complex reasoning and routing decisions
- Needs sophisticated understanding to route between agents correctly

**Tool Agents: Claude 3.5 Haiku** 
- Optimized for speed and cost on focused tasks
- Multiple calls per request, so cost efficiency matters
- Sufficient capability for single-domain operations (movies, torrents, library)

**Embeddings: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`**
- Claude doesn't offer embedding models yet
- OpenAI provides best-in-class semantic search for movie content
- 3072 dimensions give rich representation for movie plot similarity

This multi-model approach balances cost, performance, and quality across the system's different needs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Poetry** (for dependency management)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended for easy setup)

### ‚ö° Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

**This is the easiest way to get started!** Docker Compose will set up all the infrastructure services for you.

#### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd turtle-app
```

#### Step 2: Configure API Keys
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys (required for AI features)
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Required API Keys to add to `.env`:**
- `CLAUDE_API`: Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Get from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Get from [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io/)
- `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`: Optional, get from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for tracing

#### Step 3: Start Everything
```bash
cd build
docker-compose up -d
```

**üéâ That's it!** Your services are now running:
- **Turtle App API**: http://localhost:8000
- **qBittorrent Web UI**: http://localhost:15080 (admin/adminadmin)
- **Samba Share**: Available on network ports 139/445

#### Step 4: Test the API
```bash
# Test with a simple movie question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about Terminator 2"}'

# Check health
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

#### Managing Services
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Option 2: Local Development

If you want to develop or run without Docker:

#### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone <repository-url>
cd turtle-app

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

#### Step 2: Start External Services
You'll need to run qBittorrent and Samba separately, or use Docker Compose just for infrastructure:
```bash
# Start only infrastructure services
cd build
docker-compose up -d qbittorrent nas
```

#### Step 3: Run the API
```bash
# Start the Turtle App API
poetry run turtle-app-ep
```

### üîß Configuration Details

#### Docker Compose (Default Setup)
The `.env.example` file is pre-configured for Docker Compose with sensible defaults:

```env
# Infrastructure defaults (Docker overrides these automatically)
QBITTORRENT_HOST=http://localhost:15080
SAMBA_SERVER=localhost
SAMBA_SHARE_PATH=daves

# Docker volume paths
HDD_PATH=./downloads
STACK_PATH=./volumes
```

**Services Created:**
- **qBittorrent**: `http://localhost:15080` (admin/adminadmin)
- **Samba**: Network share `\\localhost\daves` (dave/password)
- **Turtle App API**: `http://localhost:8000`

#### External Deployment
For external qBittorrent/Samba servers, see `.env.external` example:
```env
QBITTORRENT_HOST=http://192.168.1.205:15080
SAMBA_SERVER=192.168.1.205
SAMBA_SHARE_PATH=\\192.168.1.205\daves\elements_main\torrent\incomplete
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Ask the home theater assistant
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about Terminator 2"}'

# With thread ID for conversation continuity
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What about the sequel?", "thread_id": "your-thread-id"}'

# Health check
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=turtleapp

# Run tests in parallel
poetry run pytest -n auto

# Skip slow tests
poetry run pytest -m "not slow"

# Run specific test files
poetry run pytest turtleapp/tests/test_api_endpoints.py
poetry run pytest turtleapp/tests/test_torrent.py
poetry run pytest turtleapp/tests/test_library_manager.py
poetry run pytest turtleapp/tests/test_retriever.py
```
